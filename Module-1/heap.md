# Introduction to Heap â€“ Data Structure and Algorithm Tutorials

A heap is a fundamental data structure that allows efficient access to the maximum (or minimum) element in a collection. It is commonly used in algorithms for tasks such as priority queues, heap sort, and graph algorithms.

Heaps are characterized by two main properties:

1. **Complete Binary Tree**: A binary tree where every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
2. **Heap Order Property**: In a max-heap, for every node \( i \) other than the root, the value of the node is greater than or equal to the value of its parent node.

Heaps can be implemented using arrays, where the root element is stored at index 0, and for any node at index \( i \), its left child is at index \( 2i + 1 \) and its right child is at index \( 2i + 2 \).

Common operations on heaps include insertion, deletion, and peeking at the maximum (or minimum) element.
