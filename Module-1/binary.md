For a comprehensive guide to binary trees and their algorithms, visit [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-binary-tree-data-structure-and-algorithm-tutorials/).

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes, where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. These children are typically identified as the "left subtree" and "right subtree," respectively.

Binary trees have various applications in computer science, including representing hierarchical data structures, organizing data for efficient searching and retrieval, and implementing algorithms like binary search.

Key properties of binary trees include:

1. **Root Node**: The topmost node of the tree, which does not have a parent.
2. **Parent Node**: A node that has at least one child node.
3. **Leaf Node**: A node that does not have any children.
4. **Internal Node**: A node that has at least one child.
5. **Height of Tree**: The maximum number of edges on the longest path from the root node to a leaf node.

Operations commonly performed on binary trees include insertion, deletion, traversal (in-order, pre-order, and post-order), and searching for specific elements.
