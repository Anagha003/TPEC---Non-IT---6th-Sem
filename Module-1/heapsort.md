# Heap Sort â€“ Data Structures and Algorithms Tutorials

## Introduction to Heap Sort
Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. It is similar to selection sort where we first find the maximum element and place the maximum element at the end. We repeat the same process for the remaining elements.

## How does Heap Sort work?
1. The first step in heap sort is to build a heap from the input data. The heap is a binary tree where each parent node has a value greater than or equal to its children. This process ensures that the root of the heap contains the maximum element.

2. Once the heap is built, we swap the root (which contains the maximum element) with the last element in the array.

3. We then decrease the size of the heap by 1 and heapify the root of the heap to maintain the heap property.

4. We repeat steps 2 and 3 until the heap size is 1. After this process, the array is sorted.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of heap sort is O(nlogn).
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity of heap sort is O(1), as it requires only a constant amount of extra space.

## Heap Sort Implementation
Here's a basic implementation of heap sort in Python:

```python
def heapify(arr, n, i):
    largest = i
    l = 2 * i + 1
    r = 2 * i + 2

    if l < n and arr[l] > arr[largest]:
        largest = l

    if r < n and arr[r] > arr[largest]:
        largest = r

    if largest != i:
        arr[i], arr[largest] = arr[largest], arr[i]
        heapify(arr, n, largest)

def heapSort(arr):
    n = len(arr)

    # Build a maxheap.
    for i in range(n // 2 - 1, -1, -1):
        heapify(arr, n, i)

    # One by one extract elements
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        arr[i], arr[0] = arr[0], arr[i]
        heapify(arr, i, 0)

# Usage
arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7]
heapSort(arr)
print("Sorted array is", arr)
```

## Conclusion
Heap sort is a very efficient sorting algorithm based on the heap data structure. It has a time complexity of O(nlogn) and is often used in practice for sorting large datasets.
