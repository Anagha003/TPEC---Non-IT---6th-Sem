## What is a Priority Queue?

A priority queue is an abstract data type where each element has a priority assigned to it. In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority. If two elements have the same priority, they are served according to their order in the queue.

## Introduction to Priority Queue

Priority queues are often implemented using heaps, as they allow both efficient insertion and retrieval of elements. However, they can also be implemented using arrays or linked lists. The choice of implementation affects the performance of various operations.

## Implementations of Priority Queue

### Using Arrays

- **Insertion**: O(1)
- **Deletion/Retrieval**: O(n) - requires searching through the array to find the highest or lowest priority element.

### Using Binary Heaps

- **Insertion**: O(log n) - elements are added in a way that maintains the heap property.
- **Deletion/Retrieval**: O(log n) - the root is removed and the heap is restructured.
