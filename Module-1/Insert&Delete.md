# Insertion and Deletion in Heaps

You can learn about insertion and deletion operations in heaps from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-and-deletion-in-heaps/).

Heap data structure supports insertion and deletion operations along with the basic operations like insertion of an element, deleting the minimum or maximum element, and heapify to maintain the heap property. Here, we will discuss how to insert an element into a heap and how to delete the root element (minimum or maximum depending on whether it's a min-heap or max-heap).

## Insertion in Heap

Insertion operation in a heap involves two steps:

1. Insert the new element at the end of the heap.
2. Heapify the heap upwards to maintain the heap property.

## Deletion in Heap

Deletion operation in a heap involves two steps:

1. Remove the root element (minimum or maximum).
2. Replace the root with the last element of the heap.
3. Heapify the heap downwards to maintain the heap property.
