**Question 1:** In a one day international cricket match, considering no extras(no wides, no ‘no’ balls, etc.) and no overthrows.

What is the maximum number of runs a batsman can score in an ideal case?

Note:” Here we assume an ideal and little practical scenario. We assume that a batsman can not run for more than 3 runs in a ball, as otherwise there is no limit, he can run infinite runs(theoretically) in a ball, as far as the opposite team does not catch the ball.”

**Question 2:** Four people need to cross a rickety bridge at night. Unfortunately, they have one torch and the bridge is too dangerous to cross without a torch. The bridge can support only two people at a time. All the people don’t take the same time to cross the bridge. Time for each person: 1 min, 2 mins, 7 mins, and 10 mins. What is the shortest time needed for all four of them to cross the bridge?

**Question 3:**: A car has 4 tyres and 1 spare tyre. Each tyre can travel a maximum distance of 20000 km before wearing off. What is the maximum distance the car can travel before you are forced to buy a new tyre? You are allowed to change tyres (using the spare tyre) an unlimited number of times.

**Input and Output**
Write a program that takes a character as input and prints 1, 0, or -1 according to the following rules:

- 1, if the character is an uppercase alphabet (A - Z).
- 0, if the character is a lowercase alphabet (a - z).
- -1, if the character is not an alphabet.

**Example:**

Input: The character is 'a'.

Output: 0

Explanation: The input character is lowercase, so the output is 0.

**Data Types**

Data type refers to the type of value a variable has and the way the computer interprets it.

Each data type has a different size. You've studied 5 different data types and their sizes:

- Integer: 4 bytes
- Long: 8 bytes
- Float: 4 bytes
- Double: 8 bytes
- Character: 1 byte

Given a data type, print its size in bytes.

**Example:**

Input: Long

Output: 8

Explanation: The size of a Long variable is 8 bytes.
