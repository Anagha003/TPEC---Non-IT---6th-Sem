**Puzzles**

**Question 1:** In a one day international cricket match, considering no extras(no wides, no ‘no’ balls, etc.) and no overthrows.

What is the maximum number of runs that a batsman can score in an ideal case ?

Note:”Here we assume ideal and little practical scenario. We assume that batsman can not run for more than 3 runs in a ball, as otherwise there is no limit, he can run infinite runs(theoretically) in a ball, as far as opposite team does not catch the ball.”

**Question 2:** Four people need to cross a rickety bridge at night. Unfortunately, they have one torch and the bridge is too dangerous to cross without a torch. The bridge can support only two people at a time. All the people don’t take the same time to cross the bridge. Time for each person: 1 min, 2 mins, 7 mins, and 10 mins. What is the shortest time needed for all four of them to cross the bridge?
